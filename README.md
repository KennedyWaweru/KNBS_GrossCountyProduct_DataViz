Visualizing County Level Data on a map using R

Gross County Product (GCP) is a geographic breakdown of Kenya’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) that gives
an estimate of the size and structure of the 47 county economies. It also provides a benchmark for evaluating
the growth of county economies over time.

The aim of this repo is to visualize this data on a map to allow ease of comparison between the different counties over the years 2013-2020

Will also include a tutorial of how to do the same in R and leaflet and an interactive shiny app
